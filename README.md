# Case Study – ZayZoon Incorporated
## Overview and Origin:
ZayZoon Incorporated is a Canadian FinTech firm based in Calgary Alberta with offices and operations in Canada, United States, and Australia.  While the company is considered to be part of the FinTech loan domain and most closely associated with payday loan providers, ZayZoon is actually part of a growing sector of Wages On-Demand service providers based in Canada and the United States.

ZayZoon was founded by Tate Hackert (Co-Founder & President), Darcy Tuer (Co-Founder & Chief Executive Officer), and Jamie Ha (Co-Founder & Chief Financial Officer) in 2014 in Calgary Alberta.  

Before founding ZayZoon, Tate Hackert spent many years making personal loans through ads posted on Craigslist and Kijiji.  Through making these loans, Tate gained a deep understanding of the demand for short-term, small-dollar loans.  He saw the problems that many people faced financially and how so many of them lived paycheck to paycheck.  His research showed that the current industry, dominated by payday loan services was riddled with high interest rates, predatory practices, and debt creating tendencies.  ZayZoon was founded in an attempt to solve this problem.
### Founders: 
Tate Hackert is currently the President of ZayZoon.  He is a graduate from the University of Victoria, Canada, and City University of Hong Kong with a degree in Economics. Between the ages of sixteen and twenty-three, Tate lent out more than $250,000 in personal loans through Kijiji and Craigslist, which eventually gave him the idea of ZayZoon.

Darcy Tuer is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ZayZoon.  Prior to helping found ZayZoon, Darcy spent eleven years at Spira Data Corporation where he served as the company’s President.  In 2000 while studying electrical engineering at the University of Alberta, he founded a software company named Halo Networks Incorporated.

Jamie Ha is currently the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of ZayZoon.  Prior to founding ZayZoon, Jamie spent over fourteen years working as an investment banker, most recently as a Managing Director at FirstEnergy Capital Corp.  Jamie holds a Bachelor’s in commerce, finance from the University of Calgary and is a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA).
### Funding:
ZayZoon initial funding was through angle investors.  However, details of this funding was not located publicly.

The company is currently in Series A round funding.  In March of 2019, ZayZoon raised $15 million from institutional and private investors, including Prairie Merchant Corporation and Bluesky Equities Limited.  In addition to this, ZayZoon raised $3.5 million in June of 2020.  Besides Prairie Merchant and Bluesky Equities, other major investors includes Adventure Capital Incorporated and Quirky Capital. The company also received $25,000 from Innovate Financial Health. 
## Business Activity:
ZayZoon was founded with the idea that they could provide their customers with access to payroll funds before they receive their paycheck, without the high cost and potential downside associated with payday loan operations.

ZayZoon is not a payday lender, even though they have consistently been thrown into that category.  ZayZoon offers advances on wages earned, not loans on future pay.  Fees charged by the company are typically less than twenty percent of what traditional payday loan providers charge.

ZayZoon partners with payroll service providers and employers directly, to allow employees the ability to receive payroll funds before their paycheck is issued.  This service has been dubbed Early Wages On-Demand.

These employees can use the ZayZoon online portal or their app to choose how much of their earned wages they would like to access, and then have those funds immediately transferred to their bank accounts, usually within thirty seconds.  The funds are then, subsequently debited from their payroll check by their employer, prior to being dispersed to the employee.

The ZayZoon system can be used entirely online and requires no app to download, although an app is available.  The service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year, with a flat fee of $5.00 that can be paid by the employee, employer, or a combination of both.  In most cases, employees can access up to $200 daily.  However, this amount is based on how much the employee has earned in the current pay period to date, and may also be limited by individual employers restrictions.  Employees also have access to personal finance education through ZayZoon financial education platform called ZayU, which offers online finance courses and budgeting tools free of charge.

For employers who choose to partner with ZayZoon, they are offered Wages On-Demand services and infrastructure, and financial education to their employees, all at no charge to the employer.

ZayZoon service is currently available to over two million employees in North America and Australia.
### Competitive Advantage:
There are several advantages that ZayZoon has over traditional payday loan operators.  Some of the key advantages are integration directly into an employer’s payroll systems, lower fee structure, and a focus on personal financial education.

ZayZoon focus on partnering with payroll service providers and employers, allows their system to integrate directly into the employers payroll system.  This has two key advantages over traditional payday loan providers.  

First, ZayZoon is able to know how much an employee has earned in the pay period to date and provide an advance based on that amount.  In most cases, employees who works on a Monday, can log into the ZayZoon system on Tuesday, and see exactly how much money they earned the prior day, and withdraw up to $200 of that amount.  Traditional payday loan providers relies on the borrower’s paystub or other financial documents to estimate their pay for the current and/or next pay period, without directly knowing how many hours they have worked or plan to work, or how much pay they are actually entitled to, before making loan.  This feature puts ZayZoon in a less risky scenario, by knowing exactly how much money the employee has earned and basing their advance amount on that. 

Second, unlike traditional payday loan providers, ZayZoon has access to all of a company’s employees when the company partners with them.  This gives ZayZoon more credibility, as most employees introduction to the ZayZoon, is directly through their employer, either by Human Resources or their manager. ZayZoon partners pass out brochures to their employees, explaining ZayZoon services, and how they can access them.  Traditional payday loan providers must rely on ads and commercials, and have no direct access to an individual unless they choose to use their service.  

ZayZoon $5.00 flat fee is lower and a simpler fee structure than traditional payday loan providers.  ZayZoon’s access to the employee’s actual earned wages reduces their risk of default, allowing them to charge less in fees than traditional payday loan providers who must account for losses due to client default.  Traditional payday loan providers charge $15 - $20 for every $100 borrowed.  Based on an annual percentage rate, that can range from 391% to more than 521% for a traditional payday loan.  The $5.00 flat fee charged by ZayZoon saves employees money, and makes the service more appealing. 

In additional to integration into the employer payroll system and lower fees, ZayZoon also offers a financial education program with free online courses and budgeting tools.  Employees are able to take advantage of these programs to help them gain control over their personal finances.
### Technologies:
ZayZoon uses an online portal as the primarily way for users to access their services.  Once a company has partnered with ZayZoon, along with brochures and other documentation received from their employer about ZayZoon services, employees of that company also receives an introduction email from ZayZoon with a link to access their online portal.  The online portal can also be accessed directly on the ZayZoon website at https://www.zayzoon.com/employees.  ZayZoon also offers an app, which can connect with their services, on Google Play Store and Apple App Store, giving employees an additional way to access their services.

In order to transfer funds directly to employees within minutes, ZayZoon uses the Visa card and MasterCard networks.  These networks process the transactions between ZayZoon and the employees and allows for quick settlement of the funds.

ZayZoon uses an application programming interface (API) in order to quickly and securely integrate their services into payroll service providers and employer’s payroll systems.  Payroll service providers and employers can implement the service at no cost to them and in most cases, the service is available time the implementation is complete.
## Landscape:
Within the financial services industry, ZayZoon is classified under lending closely associated with payday loan providers.  However, ZayZoon is part of a growing list of companies now operating in what is being called the Wages On-Demand sector which integrates into an employer’s payroll system and allows employees to receive all or part of their pay as soon as a day after performing the work.

Over the past five years, several companies based in the United States and in Canada has entered the Wages On-Demand sector.  Besides ZayZoon, these companies includes PerPay Incorporated, Even Responsible Finance Incorporated, PayActiv Incorporated, ActiveHours Incorporated, d/b/a Earnin, and DailyPay Incorporated.

Besides the number of companies that have entered this sector over the last five years, human resource professionals are now viewing Wages On-Demand as an additional benefit to offer their employees.  According to the Bloomberg Tax article, On-Demand Pay, a Trend That Is Here to Stay, Panelists Say published on June 8, 2020, by 2020 On-Demand pay was seen as a top priority and a must have solution to improve employee experience by 25% of payroll professionals, up from 10% in 2018.  

Given that more people in the United States and Canada are living paycheck to paycheck, demand for Wages On-Demand is expected to only increase.  In the article On-Demand Pay Broadens Workers’ Financial Well-Being published by SHRM on September 17, 2019, Ron Hanscome, at Gartner Incorporated believes On-Demand pay is a growing phenomenon.  In his research, On-demand pay is projected to grow quickly. Currently, fewer than 5% of large employers with hourly workers offer on-demand pay, however, given the adoption rate, it is expected to reach 20% by 2023.

In addition to allowing a company’s employees access to their earned wages, Wages On-Demand has also lead to an increase in employee retention, employee satisfaction, and reduction in overall labor cost for employers who have implemented these services.

According to the article On-Demand Pay Apps Are Catching On published by SHRM on December 11, 2018, In December of 2017, Walmart added Wages On-Demand as a benefit to many of their employees.  As of 2018, 250,000 Walmart employees, approximately 20% of their labor force had access to Wages On-Demand, with continued expansion expected.
### Competitors in the Wages On-Demand Sector:
**PerPay Incorporated** (https://perpay.com/) – PerPay is a marketplace platform which allows the user to purchase merchandise using income based spending limits, which are paid through automated direct payments from the user’s paycheck.  The company was founded in 2014 by Chris DIMarco and David Hayne and is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.  PerPay has received approximately $2.5 million in funding to date.

**Even Responsible Finance Incorporated** (https://www.even.com/) – Even is a financial service company offering Wages On-Demand.  The company was founded in 2014 by Cem Kent, Jon Schlossberg, Quinten Farmer, and Ryan Gomba, and is based in Oakland, California, United States.  Even has received approximately $52 million in funding to date. Major Partners include Walmart, Humana, PayPal, Wesco and Pitney Bowes.

**PayActiv Incorporated** (https://www.payactiv.com/) – PayActiv offers Wages On-Demand and online tools for personal finance management.

**ActiveHours Incorporated**, d/b/a Earnin (https://www.earnin.com/) – Earnin provides Wages On-Demand services, but unlike other FinTech firms in this sector, Earnin does not charge a flat fee.  Instead, they operate on a “pay what you believe is fair” model.  The company was founded in 2012 by Ram Palaniappan, and is based in Palo Alto, California, United States.  Earnin has received approximately $190.1 million in funding to date.

**DailyPay Incorporated** (https://www.dailypay.com/) – DailyPay is a FinTech company focused on earned income software that integrates into companies’ payroll and time management systems to allow employees advance access to their pay.  The company was founded in 2015 by Jason Lee and Robert Law and is based out of New York, New York, United States.  Major partners includes Kroger, Adecco, BrightSprings Health Services, and Vera Bradley.
## Results:
ZayZoon has continued to expand their business operations with operations now in Canada, the United States, and Australia.  Major corporate partners includes Holiday Inn, McDonalds, Burger King, Double Tree Hotels, Domino’s, Choice Hotels, and Wendy’s.  Currently, more than two million employees in Canada, the United States, and Australia have access to ZayZoon service.

While ZayZoon has not raised as much funding as some other firms in the Wages On-Demand sector, they have been able to attract several large corporations to their services.  While a complete list of their partners are not publically available, a review of some of the firms that they do mention on their website shows several companies with a high market value, and large employee base.  McDonalds Corporation alone have a $157 billion market value, and estimated two million employees when including franchises.  While all employees in the McDonalds network may not have access to ZayZoon service at this time, the partnership alone provides a huge potential for future growth for the company.  

Given the size of the firms that ZayZoon has partnered with, the company’s performance appears to be at pair with many of the other Wages On-Demand firms currently operating.

ZayZoon and other companies in the On-Demand Wages sector have completely changed the landscape in terms of short-term loans.  Payday loan providers, who rely heavily on individuals not being able to access earned wages for their profits, are at risk with the rise of ZayZoon.
## Recommendations:
ZayZoon appears to be a business positioned to succeed.  In addition, the Wages On-Demand industry appears to have high growth potential over the next few years.  However, some recommendations that I would make to the company to better position themselves for the future includes, integrated bill payment services, expansion into government benefits, and employee hour entry directly into the system.
### Integrated Bill Payment Services:
Many of the users of Wage On-Demand services stated that the reason for using the service was to cover an unforeseen expense.  In some cases, these are expenses that are paid in person.  An individual walks into a pharmacy to cover prescription medicine cost, or into an auto mechanic to cover an emergency car repair.  However, other expense include items associated with bill payments, such as overdue mortgages, utility bills, and credit card and loan payments.  

I would recommend that ZayZoon integrate a bill payment service into their system to allow users to directly pay bills without having to transfer the funds to their bank account.  This will benefit ZayZoon by first, allowing them to build more relationships and obtain potential partners with other firms, such as utility companies, credit card companies, and banks.  By setting up a bill payment arrangement with these firms, it will potentially open the door to Wages On-Demand partnerships.  Secondly, this will increase the amount of time, employees spend using ZayZoon services, and increase ZayZoon integration into the employee’s personal finances.  As employees become more financially educated through ZayU, their need for Wages On-Demand may decrease, and this will offer another avenue for ZayZoon to stay engaged with these individuals.

Since many business collecting payments electronically already utilize the Visa and MasterCard networks, the same technology can be used to set up this system.  This will allow ZayZoon to continue to use the same technology they are currently using.
### Expand Into Government Benefits:
With the rise of Covid-19, more and more people are now receiving government benefits in one form or another.  Many of these people find themselves out of work, and many of these same people are individuals, who prior to Covid-19, where living paycheck to paycheck.  

By expanding into government benefits, ZayZoon will allow people to have the same On-Demand access to funds that employees do, however with a more stable partner in federal, provincial, and state governments.  Individuals approved for government benefits are guaranteed those benefits, which reduce the risk of making the advance.  In addition, unlike a private employer who must provide daily updates of hours worked, given that an individual’s work schedule can change day to day, government payments are normally on a weekly or bi-weekly bases for the same amount each time, once the person is approved.  Daily updates will not be required.  This should lower the potential cost and risk, and provide ZayZoon access to more users than any Fortune 500 firm could offer.

Since this would simply be obtaining a new partner in the government, the technology implemented should be the same as the technology that currently exist within ZayZoon.  However, given the sensitivity of government information, additional security may be required.
### Employee Hour Entry:
One of the concerns that human resource professions had about Wages On-Demand is the need for managers to update employees worked hours every day.  For a company that does not require this, the added time across all their managers could add a significant additional cost to partnering with ZayZoon.

By allowing employees to enter the hours they worked, and then sending a request to the company to verify those hours, this will help to alleviate that added cost to the employers.  Given that, not every employee will be utilizing the service every day, the number of hours that would need to be verified will be a small portion of the number of hours that would have needed to be entered by the manager.  While this will no doubt create a delay in the settlement of funds by a day or so, it will allow ZayZoon to offer their services to more companies who may be hesitant to take them on due to the potential increase in cost.

To do this, ZayZoon will need to build additional features within their online portal and phone apps to collect this data from the employee.  In addition, they will need to build a secure communication platform to request approval of hours from the employer.
